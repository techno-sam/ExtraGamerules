==============

## Description
Chicken Hat is a vanilla+ mod. It adds several new things:

### Dyed Chickens
* Dyed chickens spawn naturally where chickens do, and with the same frequency as chickens.
* Naturally spawning dyed chickens as well as dyed chickens from a spawn egg are given either a light or a dark variant of one of the 16 dye colors.
* Dyed chickens will lay eggs that will hatch into more dyed chickens of the same color.
* Breeding dyed chickens will produce a chick with the average color of the two parents.

### Winged Caps
* Winged caps are crafted with a leather cap and a feather in a smithing table, and preserve their color.
* Winged caps offer no armor protection, but instead, by using one on a dyed chicken, the cap gets equipped and the chicken starts riding on the player's head.

### Dyed Chicken-Based Flight
* By having a dyed chicken ride on the player's head, the player falls at the same speed as a chicken would, and has no fall damage.
* **Note:** this effect is deactivated while sneaking, and while flying with an elytra.
* The dyed chicken is also not immune to damage such as suffocation damage, and when the chicken dies, the player fill plummet to the ground.

### Winged Caps on Non-Player Entities
* If a winged cap is equipped on a non-player entity, it renders a visual-only dyed chicken of the same color as the cap, and the same age as the entity wearing the cap.
* These dyed chickens will have easter egg effects applied to them as if the name of the cap was their nametag.

### Easter Eggs
Did you really think I would spoil that?

## Dependencies
This mod requires [Mantle](https://curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/mantle).

## Potential Future Expansion
* Make all entities that dyed chickens ride on fall slowly.
* Add feather cushions to create blocks that can be dyed in as wide a range of colors as dyed chickens can.
* More easter eggs
